# Matrix World
Kyle who is a CMO, Matrix Labs: blockchain enthusiast, invest in bitcoin & NFTs
Matrix World: its vision is to create a Turing complete multi-chain MetaVerse that provides users with a higher level of customization & experience.(creator friendly, immersive experience & social experience). To accommodate experience & non-experience developers. 

Their competitors are Decentraland, The Sandbox, CryptoVoxels which are most popular meta-verse ecosystems that run on Ethereum and are single-chain.
## Key features
### multi-chain connectivity
- users can experience a world with unlimited possibilities by connecting to multi-chain Dapps, external services & other resources. Gives access to the ecosystem, smart contracts built in different networks in one front-end. Unlike single-chain fragmentation, meta-verse is virtual world that should be limited to one blockchain network.
### Advantages of Multi-Chain
- *Identity*: multi-chain identity system technology maintains user identity across multiple blockchains to allow users to seamlessly use one identity to interact with multiple networks.
- *External contracts*: users can fluidly interact with smart contracts on different blockchain networks hence removing limitations imposed by single-chain meta-verse
- *External Services*: users will have access to external services like NFT marketplaces, storage protocols, streaming services etc.
- *Extensible*: currently Matrix World supports Flow and Ethereum but Multi-chain connectivity can easily be expanded to support more networks.

### immersive 3D Dapps
- creators can enrich and extend the world by building immersive 3D decentralized applications that can connect to external services and applications. Matrix World has collaborated with Chain IDE.

### programmable NFTs & Objects
- All in-game objects and NFTs have their own life-cycles. Landowners can customize their behaviors, appearances and transformations via Turing-Complete programs. 
- Users will be allowed to import and create NFTs. Matrix Objects are either scene(top-level object - parent/container) or entity(lower-level object i.e children) objects. The space virtual machines(SVM) - memory for computation is available on Spaces whole making up the Matrix Network.

### convenient automated tooling
The network will support non-developer with these no-code tools
- WYSIWYG(what you see is what you get) model editor: users adjust lighting, texture etc.
- scene editor
- automated templated for building(buy templates at a marketplace created by developers or designers)
- space name server
